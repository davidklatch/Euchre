# Euchre
A Euchre card game made in Flash in 2013. The computer players are not very smart.

Unfortunately, Flash has gone the way of the Dodo. But there are ways to play Flash files. I have added the .swf file to the project [here](https://github.com/davidklatch/Euchre/tree/master/swf) and Opera version [48](https://ftp.opera.com/pub/opera/desktop/48.0.2685.52/) plays swf files. You can just drag and drop it into the browser.
